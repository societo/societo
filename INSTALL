After extract, and if you work it in your local machine, please upload the extracted package to your web server.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Create database for Societo before your installation.

(In this section, DBNAME is the name of your new database. And $username or username is a MySQL account)

Log in to MySQL prompt (or access to your phpMyAdmin panel)::

    mysql -u $username -p

Create database to use::

    CREATE DATABASE DBNAME DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;

Grant privilege to your database user (if you need / see also : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/grant.html)::

    GRANT CREATE, DROP, ALTER, INDEX, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT ON DBNAME.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Flush privileges::

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

3. Copy some files and set permissions
--------------------------------------

First, copy the default configuration file. The file in app/config/default/parameters.ini. You need to copy it as app/config/parameters.ini.
